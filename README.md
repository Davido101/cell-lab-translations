# Guide

## Contributing: You <b><i>MUST</i></b> follow these rules if you wish to contribute.

- Only modify the file for the language you have been assigned to
- Translate as well as possible
- If you're not sure about a translation, leave it blank
- If you're changing or replacing someone else's translation, you MUST communicate what you've changed and why
- Don't translate or change names in any way, keep them exactly as is

## Modding: This is how you add this to your mod
Adding this to your mod is super simple

First, you will have to go to your `res` folder<br>
Next, you will have to plop in every `values` folder, replacing your current ones<br>
Finally, you will have to replace your `arrays.xml` file with the one here. Or, if you've already modified it and don't want to lose your changes, only replace the `language_ids` and `language_names` fields
